<acronym>WebDAV</acronym> is a <emphasis>D</emphasis>istributed <emphasis>A</emphasis>uthoring and <emphasis>V</emphasis>ersioning protocol for the World Wide Web. It allows for easy management of documents and scripts on a <ulink url="help:/kioslave/webdav.html">http</ulink> server, and has additional features designed to simplify version management amongst multiple authors.
Usage of this protocol is simple. Type the location you want to view, similar to a <acronym>http</acronym> URL except for the webdav:// protocol name at the start. An example is <userinput>webdav://<replaceable>www.hostname.com/path/</replaceable></userinput>. If you specify a folder name, a list of files and folders will be displayed, and you can manipulate these folders and files just as you would with any other filesystem.
WebDAV Features
Locking
File locking allows users to lock a file, informing others that they are currently working on this file. This way, editing can be done without fear that the changes may be overwritten by another person who is also editing the same document.
Source file access
<acronym>WebDAV</acronym> allows access to the script which is called to produce a specific page, so changes can be made to the script itself.
Per-document property support
Arbitrary properties may be set to assist identification of a document, such as the author.
To take advantage of these additional capabilities, you will need an application which supports them. No application currently supports them through this kioslave.
<acronym>WebDAVS</acronym> is the <acronym>WebDAV</acronym> protocol encrypted via SSL.

The kioslave mailto is responsible for launching the mail composer of your choice when you open a &URL; in the mailto scheme (<ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6068">RFC6068</ulink>).
Syntax
The syntax of a mailto &URL; follows the following pattern:
mailto:recipients?query
where recipients form a list of restricted &SMTP; address specifications, and the query part may contain one or more of the following parameters:
&amp;to=recipients
Specifies additional recipients.
&amp;cc=recipients
Specifies additional recipients of carbon copies.
&amp;bcc=recipients
Specifies additional recipients of blind carbon copies. These recipients will receive the message, but all other recipients will not know about that.
&amp;body=text
Specifies the text of the message. This text should not be long, as there may be hard limits on how long an &URL; may be.
&amp;subject=text
Specifies the subject of the message.
Example
mailto:info@kde.org?cc=kde@kde.org&amp;subject=Thank%20you!&amp;body=KDE%20rocks!%20How%20can%20I%20help%3F

Check Spelling Dialog
&David.Sweet; &David.Sweet.mail;
2010-09-02
&sonnet; is the spelling checker used by &kde; applications such as &kate;, &kmail;, and &kword;. It is a &GUI; frontend to various free spell checkers. More Information about required spell checkers and dictionaries you find in the documentation of the &systemsettings; module <ulink url="help:kcontrol/spellchecking">Spell Checker</ulink>.
spell

sonnet
ispell

<keyword>KDE</keyword>
The top line in the dialog displays a possibly misspelled word which was found in your document. &sonnet; attempts to find an appropriate replacement word. One or several may be found.
The best guess is shown to the right of <guilabel>Replace with</guilabel>. To accept this replacement, click on <guibutton>Replace</guibutton>.
You may also select a word from the list of suggestions and then click <guibutton>Replace</guibutton> to replace the misspelled word with the selected word. To add more suggestions from the dictionary to the suggestions list click the <guibutton>Suggest</guibutton> button.
To keep your original spelling, click on <guilabel>Ignore</guilabel>.
To stop the spellchecking -- keeping the changes you've already made -- click on <guibutton>Finished</guibutton>.
To stop the spellchecking and cancel the changes you've already made, click on <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton>.
Clicking on <guibutton>Replace All</guibutton> will initially perform the same function as clicking on <guibutton>Replace</guibutton>, but will automatically replace the misspelled word with the chosen replacement word, if it appears again (at a later point) in your document.
The <guibutton>Ignore All</guibutton> button ignores this and all future occurrences of the misspelled word.
Clicking on <guibutton>Add to Dictionary</guibutton> will add the misspelled word to your personal dictionary (this is distinct from the original system dictionary, so the additions you make will not be seen by other users).
The drop down box <guilabel>Language</guilabel> at the bottom of this dialog allows you to switch to another dictionary temporarily.
The default configuration options are available in the &systemsettings; module <ulink url="help:kcontrol/spellchecking">Spell Checker</ulink>.
http / https
<acronym>http</acronym> is the <emphasis>H</emphasis>yper<emphasis>T</emphasis>ext <emphasis>T</emphasis>ransfer <emphasis>P</emphasis>rotocol.
The http kioslave is used by all &kde; applications to handle connections to http servers, that is, web servers. The most common usage is to view web pages in the &konqueror; web browser.
You can use the http kioslave in &konqueror; by giving it a <acronym>URL</acronym>. <userinput>http://<replaceable>www.kde.org</replaceable></userinput>.
https is http encapsulated in a SSL/TLS stream.
SSL is the Secure Sockets Layer protocol, a security protocol that provides communications privacy over the Internet. The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.
TLS stands for Transport Layer Security.
&FTP;
&FTP; is the Internet service used to transfer a data file from the disk of one computer to the disk of another, regardless of the operating system type.
Similar to other Internet applications, &FTP; uses the client-server approach &mdash; a user invokes an &FTP; program on the computer, instructs it to contact a remote computer, and then requests the transfer of one or more files. The local &FTP; program becomes a client that uses <acronym>TCP</acronym> to contact an &FTP; server program on the remote computer. Each time the user requests a file transfer, the client and the server programs cooperate to send a copy of the data across the Internet.
&FTP; servers which allow <quote>anonymous &FTP;</quote> permit any user, not only users with accounts on the host, to browse the <quote>ftp</quote> archives and download files. Some &FTP; servers are configured to allow users to upload files.
&FTP; is commonly used to retrieve information and obtain software stored in files at &FTP; archive sites throughout the world.

Data URLs
<personname><firstname>Leo</firstname><surname>Savernik</surname></personname> <address><email>l.savernik@aon.at</email></address>
2003-02-06
Data URLs allow small document data to be included in the URL itself. This is useful for very small HTML testcases or other occasions that do not justify a document of their own.
<userinput>data:,foobar</userinput> (note the comma after the colon) will deliver a text document that contains nothing but <literal>foobar</literal>
The last example delivered a text document. For HTML documents one has to specify the MIME type <literal>text/html</literal>: <userinput>data:text/html,&lt;title&gt;Testcase&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a testcase&lt;/p&gt;</userinput>. This will produce exactly the same output as if the content had been loaded from a document of its own.
Specifying alternate character sets is also possible. Note that 8-Bit characters have to be escaped by a percentage sign and their two-digit hexadecimal codes: <userinput>data:;charset=iso-8859-1,Gr%FC%DFe aus Schl%E4gl</userinput> results in <literal>Gr&uuml;&szlig;e aus Schl&auml;gl</literal> whereas omitting the charset attribute might lead to something like <literal>Gr??e aus Schl?gl</literal>

Disable Window Manager context menu (Alt-F3)
The Window Manager context menu is normally shown when Alt-F3 is pressed or when the menu button on the window frame is pressed.
Disable Bookmarks
Disable Bookmarks in all applications.
Disable all tasks and applications that require root access
In multi-user environments the users normally do not know the root password; in such a case, it may be desirable to use this option to remove the tasks and applications from the menus that the users cannot use.
Disable access to a command shell
In an environment where the desktop is dedicated to a defined set of tasks it may be desirable to disable access to a command shell to prevent users from engaging in tasks that were not intended or authorized; hence, it is strongly recommended to disable access to a command shell if the desktop is to act as a public terminal.
Disable Logout option
This prevents the user from logging out. To make this option effective it is important to ensure that key-combinations to terminate the X-server, such as Alt-Ctrl-Backspace, are disabled in the configuration of the X-server.
Disable Lock Screen option
When the desktop is to act as a public terminal or is to be shared by different users it may be desirable to prevent locking of the screen to ensure that the system remains accessible if a user leaves the terminal.
Disable "Run Command" option (Alt-F2)
The "Run Command" option can normally be used to execute arbitrary commands; however, when access to a command shell is restricted only applications and services defined by a .desktop file can be started this way. Disabling "Run Command" here hides the option completely.
Disable toolbar moving
Normally toolbars in applications can be moved around; when this option is chosen all toolbars are fixed in their original positions.
Disable execution of arbitrary .desktop files
This option defines whether users may execute .desktop files that are not part of the system-wide desktop icons, KDE menu, registered services or autostart services. When access to a command shell is restricted it is recommended to disable the execution of arbitrary .desktop files as well since such .desktop files can be used to circumvent the command shell restriction.
Disable starting of a second X session
KDM has the possibility to login a second user in parallel to the current session. Note that this can also be configured as part of the KDM settings in which case the setting here should be left enabled.
Disable input line history
If a single account is used by multiple people it may be desirable to disable the input line history out of privacy considerations.
Enforce DRM restrictions
Some KDE applications can enforce DRM restrictions on content. You may want to enable this if your organisation relies on such restrictions or if local law requires it.
Prevent Downloading
Some KDE applications can prevent the user from downloading or uploading files. The normal web browsing experience will not be affected. Note that you still have to set up the unix file permissions correctly - treat this as merely cosmetic for security.
Desktop Icons
Desktop Icons are provided by "kdesktop".
Lock down Desktop Settings
When the desktop settings are locked down the user can no longer change how the desktop behaves or what it looks like. This does not affect the ability to add new files or shortcuts to the desktop.
Disable context menus
When checked the user will no longer get any context menu. Normally the user can get a context menu by clicking with the right mouse button.
Lock down all Desktop icons
When checked the user will not be able to remove or edit any existing icons or files on the Desktop, or add any new icons or files.
Lock down system-wide Desktop icons
When checked the user will not be able to remove or edit any of the system-wide icons but will still be able to add, remove or edit personal icons or files on the desktop.
Add additional vendor specific icons
When this option is checked users will get additional icons copied to their Desktop when they first log in. These icons do not appear in the preview.
Desktop Background
Set up the Desktop Background also known as Wallpaper.
Lock down Desktop Background Settings
When the desktop background settings are locked down the user can no longer change them.
Screen Saver
Set up Screen Saver
Lock down Screen Saver Settings
When the Screen Saver settings are locked down the user can no longer change them.
Disable OpenGL-based Screen Savers
OpenGL-based screen savers may cause problems on systems without decent OpenGL support; with this option all such screensavers can be disabled.
Discreet Screen Savers Only
Some screensavers do not hide the complete screen content and may leave possible sensitive information visible. This option disables all such screensavers and only enables those screensavers that completely hide the original content of the screen.
KDE Menu
The KDE Application menu
This option disables all menu items that require root access and that will ask the user for the root password.
Disable menu editing
This disables the menu-option to edit the KDE Application Menu. When disabled, users will no longer be able to make changes to their personal application menu.
Theming
Set up of Fonts, Colors and Style
Lock down Style Settings
When the Style settings are locked down the user can no longer change them.
Lock down Color Settings
When the Color settings are locked down the user can no longer change them.
Lock down Font Settings
When the Font settings are locked down the user can no longer change them.
Lock down Window Decoration Settings
When the Window Decoration settings are locked down the user can no longer change them.
Panel
The KDE panel "kicker" is normally found at the bottom of the screen.
Lock down panel
This option can be used to lock down the panel. The user will then no longer be able to add, remove or change any of the permanent panel items.
Disable Context Menus
This option disables the context menus that one normally gets when pressing the right mouse button in the panel.

<b>Use browsing (Browsing)</b> <p> Whether or not to <b>listen</b> to printer  information from other CUPS servers.   </p> <p> Enabled by default. </p> <p> Note: to enable the <b>sending</b> of browsing information from this CUPS server to the LAN, specify a valid <i>BrowseAddress</i>. </p> <p> <i>ex</i>: On</p>
<b>Use short names (BrowseShortNames)</b> <p> Whether or not to use "short" names for remote printers when possible (e.g. "printer" instead of "printer@host").  Enabled by default.</p> <p> <i>ex</i>: Yes</p>
<b>Browse addresses (BrowseAddress)</b> <p> Specifies a broadcast address to be used.  By default browsing information is broadcast to all active interfaces.</p> <p> Note: HP-UX 10.20 and earlier do not properly handle broadcast unless you have a Class A, B, C, or D netmask (i.e. no CIDR support).</p> <p> <i>ex</i>: x.y.z.255, x.y.255.255</p>

<b>Browse interval (BrowseInterval)</b> <p> The time between browsing updates in seconds.  Default is 30 seconds.</p> <p> Note that browsing information is sent whenever a printer's state changes as well, so this represents the maximum time between updates.</p> <p> Set this to 0 to disable outgoing broadcasts so your local printers are not advertised but you can still see printers on other hosts.</p> <p> <i>ex</i>: 30</p>
<b>Browse order (BrowseOrder)</b> <p> Specifies the order of BrowseAllow/BrowseDeny comparisons.</p> <p> <i>ex</i>: allow,deny</p>

<b>Browse relay (BrowseRelay)</b> <p> Relay browser packets from one address/network to another.</p> <p> <i>ex</i>: src-address dest-address</p>
<b>Browse timeout (BrowseTimeout)</b> <p> The timeout (in seconds) for network printers - if we don't get an update within this time the printer will be removed from the printer list.  This number definitely should not be less the BrowseInterval value for obvious reasons.  Defaults to 300 seconds.</p> <p> <i>ex</i>: 300</p>
<b>Implicit classes (ImplicitClasses)</b> <p> Whether or not to use implicit classes.</p> <p> Printer classes can be specified explicitly in the classes.conf file, implicitly based upon the printers available on the LAN, or both.</p> <p> When ImplicitClasses is On, printers on the LAN with the same name (e.g. Acme-LaserPrint-1000) will be put into a class with the same name. This allows you to setup multiple redundant queues on a LAN without a lot of administrative difficulties.  If a user sends a job to Acme-LaserPrint-1000, the job will go to the first available queue.</p> <p> Enabled by default.</p>
<b>System group (SystemGroup)</b> <p> The group name for "System" (printer administration) access.  The default varies depending on the operating system, but will be <b>sys</b>, <b>system</b>, or <b>root</b> (checked for in that order).</p> <p> <i>ex</i>: sys</p>
<b>Encryption certificate (ServerCertificate)</b> <p> The file to read containing the server's certificate. Defaults to "/etc/cups/ssl/server.crt".</p> <p> <i>ex</i>: /etc/cups/ssl/server.crt</p>

Welcome to the CUPS Server Configuration Tool
<p>This tool will help you to configure graphically the server of the CUPS printing system. The available options are grouped into sets of related topics and can be accessed quickly through the icon view located on the left. Each option has a default value that is shown if it has not been previously set. This default value should be OK in most cases.</p><br /><p>You can access a short help message for each option using either the '?' button in the title bar, or the button at the bottom of this dialog.</p>

<qt> <b>Print in Black Only (Blackplot)</b>  <p>The 'blackplot' option specifies that all pens should plot in black-only: The default is to use the colors defined in the plot file, or the standard pen colors defined in the HP-GL/2 reference manual from Hewlett Packard. </p> <br /> <hr /> <p><em><b>Additional hint for power users:</b> This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter:</em> <pre>    -o blackplot=true  </pre> </p> </qt>
<qt> <b>Scale Print Image to Page Size</b>  <p>The 'fitplot' option specifies that the HP-GL image should be scaled to fill exactly the page with the (elsewhere selected) media size. </p>  <p>The default is 'fitplot is disabled'. The default will therefore use the absolute distances specified in the plot file. (You should be aware that HP-GL files are very often CAD drawings intended for large format plotters. On standard office printers they will therefore lead to the drawing printout being spread across multiple pages.) </p> <p><b>Note:</b>This feature depends upon an accurate plot size (PS) command in the HP-GL/2 file. If no plot size is given in the file the filter converting the HP-GL to PostScript assumes the plot is ANSI E size.</p> <br /> <hr /> <p><em><b>Additional hint for power users:</b> This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter:</em> <pre>     -o fitplot=true   </pre> </p> </qt>
<qt> <b>Set Pen Width for HP-GL (if not defined in file)</b>.  <p>The pen width value can be set here in case the original HP-GL file does not have it set.

<qt> <p><b>Brightness:</b> Slider to control the brightness value of all colors used.</p> <p>The brightness value can range from 0 to 200. Values greater than 100 will lighten the print. Values less than 100 will darken the print. </p> <br /> <hr /> <p><em><b>Additional hint for power users:</b> This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter:</em> <pre>    -o brightness=...      # use range from "0" to "200" </pre> </p> </qt>
<qt> <p><b>Hue (Tint):</b> Slider to control the hue value for color rotation.</p> <p>The hue value is a number from -360 to 360 and represents the color hue rotation. The following table summarizes the change you will see for the base colors:</p> <center> <table border="1" width="70%"> <tr><th><b>Original</b></th> <th><b>hue=-45</b></th> <th><b>hue=45</b></th>   </tr> <tr><td>Red</td>             <td>Purple</td>         <td>Yellow-orange</td>   </tr> <tr><td>Green</td>           <td>Yellow-green</td>   <td>Blue-green</td>      </tr> <tr><td>Yellow</td>          <td>Orange</td>         <td>Green-yellow</td>    </tr> <tr><td>Blue</td>            <td>Sky-blue</td>       <td>Purple</td>          </tr> <tr><td>Magenta</td>         <td>Indigo</td>         <td>Crimson</td>         </tr> <tr><td>Cyan</td>            <td>Blue-green</td>     <td>Light-navy-blue</td> </tr> </table> </center> <br /> <hr /> <p><em><b>Additional hint for power users:</b> This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter:</em> <pre>    -o hue=...     # use range from "-360" to "360" </pre> </p> </qt>
<qt>  <p><b>Saturation:</b> Slider to control the saturation value for all colors used.</p> <p> The saturation value adjusts the saturation of the colors in an image, similar to the color knob on your television. The color saturation value can range from 0 to 200. On inkjet printers, a higher saturation value uses more ink. On laserjet printers, a higher saturation uses more toner. A color saturation of 0 produces a black-and-white print, while a value of 200 will make the colors extremely intense.</p> <br /> <hr /> <p><em><b>Additional hint for power users:</b> This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds  to the CUPS command line job option parameter:</em> <pre>    -o saturation=...      # use range from "0" to "200" </pre> </p> </qt>
<qt>  <p><b>Gamma:</b> Slider to control the gamma value for color correction.</p> <p> The gamma value can range from 1 to 3000. A gamma value greater than 1000 lightens the print. A gamma value less than 1000 darkens the print. The default gamma is 1000. </p> <p><b>Note:</b></p><p> the gamma value adjustment is not visible in the thumbnail preview. </p> <br /> <hr /> <p><em><b>Additional hint for power users:</b> This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter:</em> <pre>    -o gamma=...      # use range from "1" to "3000" </pre> </p> </qt>
<qt>  <p><b>Image Printing Options</b></p> <p>All options controlled on this page only apply to printing images. Most image file formats are supported. To name a few: JPEG, TIFF, PNG, GIF, PNM (PBM/PGM/PNM/PPM), Sun Raster, SGI RGB, Windows BMP. Options to influence color output of image printouts are: <ul> <li> Brightness  </li> <li> Hue         </li> <li> Saturation  </li> <li> Gamma       </li> </ul>  <p>For a more detailed explanation about Brightness, Hue, Saturation and Gamma settings, please look at the 'What's This' items provided for these controls.  </p> </p> </qt>
<qt> <p><b>Coloration Preview Thumbnail</b></p> <p>The coloration preview thumbnail indicates change of image coloration by different settings. Options to influence output are: <ul> <li> Brightness  </li> <li> Hue (Tint)  </li> <li> Saturation  </li> <li> Gamma       </li> </ul>  </p>  <p>For a more detailed explanation about Brightness, Hue, Saturation and Gamma settings, please look at the 'What's This' items provided for these controls. </p>  </qt>
<qt>  <p><b>Image Size:</b> Drop-down menu to control the image size on the printed paper. The menu works in conjunction with slider below. The options are:</p> <ul> <li><b>Natural Image Size:</b> Image prints in its natural image size. If it does not fit onto one sheet, the printout will be spread across multiple sheets. Note, that the slider is disabled when selecting 'natural image size' in the dropdown menu.</li> <li> <b>Resolution (ppi):</b> The resolution value slider covers a number range from 1 to 1200. It specifies the resolution of the image in Pixels Per Inch (PPI). An image that is 3000x2400 pixels will print 10x8 inches at 300 pixels per inch, for example, but 5x4 inches at 600 pixels per inch. If the specified resolution makes the image larger than the page, multiple pages will be printed. Resolution defaults to 72 ppi. </li> <li><b>% of Page Size:</b> The percent value slider covers numbers from 1 to 800. It specifies the size in relation to the page (not the image). A scaling of 100 percent will fill the page as completely as the image aspect ratio allows (doing auto-rotation of the image as needed). A scaling of more than 100 will print the image across multiple sheets. A scaling of 200 percent will print on up to 4 pages. Scaling in % of page size defaults to 100 %.</li> <li><b>% of Natural Image Size:</b> The percent value slider moves from 1 to 800. It specifies the printout size in relation to the natural image size. A scaling of 100 percent will print the image at its natural size, while a scaling of 50 percent will print the image at half its natural size. If the specified scaling makes the image larger than the page, multiple pages will be printed. Scaling in % of natural image size defaults to 100 %.</li> </ul> <br /> <hr /> <p><em><b>Additional hint for power users:</b> This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter:</em>  <pre>     -o natural-scaling=...     # range in  %  is 1....800 <br />     -o scaling=...             # range in  %  is 1....800 <br />     -o ppi=...                 # range in ppi is 1...1200 </pre> </p>  </qt>

<qt> <p><b>Print Job Billing and Accounting</b></p>  <p>Insert a meaningful string here to associate the current print job with a certain account. This string will appear in the CUPS "page_log" to help with the print accounting in your organization. (Leave it empty if you do not need it.)</p> <p> It is useful for people who print on behalf of different "customers", like print service bureaux, letter shops, press and prepress companies, or secretaries who serve different bosses, etc.</p> <br />  <hr />  <p><em><b>Additional hint for power users:</b> This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter:</em>  <pre>    -o job-billing=...         # example: "Marketing_Department" or "Joe_Doe"  </pre> </p>  </qt>
<qt> <p><b>Scheduled Printing</b></p>  <p>Scheduled printing lets you control the time of the actual printout, while you can still send away your job <b>now</b> and have it out of your way.</p> <p> Especially useful is the "Never (hold indefinitely)" option. It allows you to park your job until a time when you (or a printer administrator) decides to manually release it.</p> <p> This is often required in enterprise environments, where you normally are not allowed to directly and immediately access the huge production printers in your <em>Central Repro Department</em>. However it is okay to send jobs to the queue which is under the control of the operators (who, after all, need to make sure that the 10,000 sheets of pink paper which is required by the Marketing Department for a particular job are available and loaded into the paper trays.)</p> <br />  <hr />  <p><em><b>Additional hint for power users:</b> This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter:</em>  <pre>    -o job-hold-until=...      # example: "indefinite" or "no-hold"  </pre> </p>  </qt>
<qt> <p><b>Page Labels</b></p>  <p>Page Labels are printed by CUPS at the top and bottom of each page. They appear on the pages surrounded by a little frame box.</p> <p>They contain any string you type into the line edit field.</p> <br />  <hr />  <p><em><b>Additional hint for power users:</b> This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter:</em>  <pre>    -o page-label="..."      # example: "Company Confidential"  </pre> </p>  </qt>
<qt> <p><b>Job Priority</b></p>  <p>Usually CUPS prints all jobs per queue according to the "FIFO" principle: <em>First In, First Out</em>.</p> <p> The job priority option allows you to re-order the queue according to your needs.</p> <p> It works in both directions: you can increase as well as decrease priorities. (Usually you can only control your <b>own</b> jobs.)</p> <p> Since the default job priority is "50", any job sent with, for example, "49" will be printed only after all those others have finished. Conversely, a "51" or higher priority job will go right to the top of a populated queue (if no other, higher prioritized one is present.)</p> <br />  <hr />  <p><em><b>Additional hint for power users:</b> This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter:</em>  <pre>    -o job-priority=...   # example: "10" or "66" or "99"  </pre> </p>  </qt>

<qt> <b>Add Filter button</b> <p>This button calls a little dialog to let you select a filter here.</p> <p><b>Note 1:</b> You can chain different filters as long as you make sure that the output of one fits as input of the next. (KDEPrint checks your filtering chain and will warn you if you fail to do so).</p> <p><b>Note 2:</b> The filters you define here are applied to your jobfile <em><b>before</b></em> it is handed downstream to your spooler and print subsystem (e.g. CUPS, LPRng, LPD.)</p> </qt>
<qt> <b>Remove Filter button</b> <p>This button removes the highlighted filter from the list of filters.</p> </qt>
<qt> <b>Move Filter Up button</b> <p>This button moves the highlighted filter up in the list of filters, towards the front of the filtering chain. </p> </qt>
<qt> <b>Move Filter Down button</b> <p>This button moves the highlighted filter down in the list of filters, towards the end of the filtering chain..</p> </qt>
<qt> <b>Configure Filter button</b> <p>This button lets you configure the currently highlighted filter. It opens a separate dialog.  </p> </qt>
<qt> <b>Filter Info Pane</b> <p>This field shows some general info about the selected filter. Amongst them are:  <ul>  <li>the <em>filter name</em> (as displayed in the KDEPrint user interface);</li>  <li>the <em>filter requirements</em> (that is the external program that needs to be present and executable on this system);</li> <li>the <em>filter input format</em> (in the form of one or several <em>MIME types</em> accepted by the filter);</li> <li>the <em>filter output format</em> (in the form of a <em>MIME type</em> generated by the filter);</li> <li>a more- or less-verbose description of the filter's operation.</li> </ul> </p> </qt>
<qt> <b>Filtering Chain</b> (if enabled, is run <em>before</em> actual job submission to print system.) <p>This field shows which filters are currently selected to act as 'pre-filters' for KDEPrint. Pre-filters process the print files <em>before</em> they are sent down-stream to your real print subsystem.</p> <p>The list shown in this field may be empty (default).</p> <p>The pre-filters act on the print job in the order they are listed (from top to bottom). This is done by acting as a <em>filtering chain</em> where the output of one filter acts as input to the next. By putting the filters into the wrong order, you can make the filtering chain fail. For example: if your file is ASCII text, and you want the output being processed by the 'Multipage per Sheet' filter, the first filter must be one that converts ASCII into PostScript.</p> <p>KDEPrint can utilize <em>any</em> external filtering program which you may find useful through this interface.</p> <p>KDEPrint ships preconfigured with support for a selection of common filters. These filters however need to be installed independently from KDEPrint. These pre-filters work <em>for all</em> print subsystems supported by KDEPrint (such as CUPS, LPRng and LPD), because they are not dependent upon them.</p>.<p>Amongst the pre-configured filters shipping with KDEPrint are:</p> <ul> <li>the <em>Enscript text filter</em>;</li> <li>a <em>Multiple Pages per Sheet filter</em>;</li> <li>a <em>PostScript to PDF converter</em>;</li> <li>a <em>Page Selection/Ordering filter</em>;</li> <li>a <em>Poster Printing filter</em>;</li> <li>and some more....</li> </ul> <p>To insert a filter into this list, simply click on the <em>funnel</em> icon (top-most on  the right icon column group) and proceed.</p> <p>Please click on the other elements of this dialog to learn more about the KDEPrint pre-filters. </p> </qt>

If you enable this option here, the <em>'Poster Printing' filter</em> will be auto-loaded in the 'Filters' tab of this dialog. </p> <p>This tab is only visible if the external <em>'poster'</em> utility is discovered by KDEPrint on your system. [<em>'poster'</em> is a command line utility that enables you to convert PostScript files into tiled printouts, with overlap to allow the tiles to be joined together seamlessly.]</p> <p><b>Note:</b> The standard version of 'poster' will not work. Your system must use a patched version of 'poster'.

<qt><b>Selective View on List of Printers:</b> <p> This button reduces the list of visible printers to a shorter, more convenient, pre-defined list.</p> <p>This is particularly useful in enterprise environments with lots of printers. The default is to show <b>all</b> printers.</p> <p>To create a personal <em>'selective view list'</em>, click on the <em>'System Options'</em> button at the bottom of this dialog. Then, in the new dialog, select <em>'Filter'</em> (left column in the <em>KDE Print Configuration</em> dialog) and setup your selection.</p> <p><b>Warning:</b> Clicking this button without prior creation of a personal <em>'selective view list'</em> will make all printers dissappear from the view. (To re-enable all printers, just click this button again.) </p>  </qt>
<qt><b>KDE Add Printer Wizard</b> <p>This button starts the <em>KDE Add Printer Wizard</em>.</p> <p>Use the Wizard (with <em>"CUPS"</em> or <em>"RLPR"</em>) to add locally defined printers to your system. </p> <p><b>Note:</b> The <em>KDE Add Printer Wizard</em> does <b>not</b> work, and this button is disabled if you use <em>"Generic LPD</em>", <em>"LPRng"</em>, or <em>"Print Through an External Program</em>".) </p> </qt>

<qt><b>Help:</b> This button takes you to the complete <em>KDEPrint Manual</em>. </qt>
<qt><b>Cancel:</b> This button cancels your print job and quits the kprinter dialog. </qt>
<qt><b>Print:</b> This button sends the job to the printing process. If you are sending non-PostScript files, you may be asked if you want KDE to convert the files into PostScript, or if you want your print subsystem (like CUPS) to do this. </qt>
<qt><b>Keep Printing Dialog Open</b><p>If you enable this checkbox, the printing dialog stays open after you hit the <em>Print</em> button.</p> <p> This is especially useful, if you need to test various print settings (like color matching for an inkjet printer) or if you want to send your job to multiple printers (one after the other) to have it finished more quickly.</p> </qt>
<qt><b>Output File Name and Path:</b> The "Output file:" shows  you where your file will be saved if you decide to "Print to File" your job, using one of the KDE <em>Special Printers</em> named "Print to File (PostScript)" or "Print to File (PDF)". Choose a name and location that suits your need by using the button and/or editing the line on the right. </qt>
<qt><b>Output File Name and Path:</b> Edit this line to create a  path and filename that suits your needs. (Button and Lineedit field are only available if you "Print to File") </qt>
<qt><b>Browse Directories button:</b> This button calls the "File Open / Browse Directories" dialog to let you choose a directory and file name where your "Print-to-File" job should be saved. </qt>
<qt><b>Add File to Job</b> <p>This button calls the "File Open / Browse Directories" dialog to allow you to select a file for printing. Note, that</p> <ul><li>you can select ASCII or International Text, PDF, PostScript, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, GIF and many other graphical formats.</li> <li>you can select various files from different paths and send them as one "multi-file job" to the printing system.</li> </ul> </qt>
<qt><b>Print Preview</b> Enable this checkbox if you want to see a preview of your printout. A preview lets you check if, for instance, your intended "poster" or "pamphlet" layout looks like you expected, without wasting paper first. It also lets you cancel the job if something looks wrong. <p><b>Note:</b> The preview feature (and therefore this checkbox) is only visible for printjobs created from inside KDE applications. If you start kprinter from the commandline, or if you use kprinter as a print command for non-KDE applications (like Acrobat Reader, Firefox or OpenOffice), print preview is not available here.</p> </qt>
<qt><b>Set as Default Printer</b> This button sets the current printer as the user's default.  <p><b>Note:</b> (Button is only visible if the checkbox for <em>System Options</em> --> <em>General</em> --> <em>Miscellaneous</em>: <em>"Defaults to the last printer used in the application"</em> is disabled.)</p> </qt>

Printer Filtering Settings
Printer Filter
The printer filtering allows you to view only a specific set of printers instead of all of them. This may be useful when there are a lot of printers available but you only use a few ones. Select the printers you want to see from the list on the left or enter a <b>Location</b> filter (ex: Group_1*). Both are cumulative and ignored if empty.

Font Settings
Fonts Embedding
Fonts Path
&Embed fonts in PostScript data when printing
Additional director&y:
These options will automatically put fonts in the PostScript file which are not present on the printer. Font embedding usually produces better print results (closer to what you see on the screen), but larger print data as well.
When using font embedding you can select additional directories where KDE should search for embeddable font files. By default, the X server font path is used, so adding those directories is not needed. The default search path should be sufficient in most cases.
Refresh Interval
This time setting controls the refresh rate of various <b>KDE Print</b> components like the print manager and the job viewer.

An identification string. Use only alphanumeric characters except spaces. The string <b>__root__</b> is reserved for internal use.
A description string. This string is shown in the interface, and should be explicit enough about the role of the corresponding option.
The type of the option. This determines how the option is presented graphically to the user.
The format of the option. This determines how the option is formatted for inclusion in the global command line. The tag <b>%value</b> can be used to represent the user selection. This tag will be replaced at run-time by a string representation of the option value.
The default value of the option. For non persistent options, nothing is added to the command line if the option has that default value. If this value does not correspond to the actual default value of the underlying utility, make the option persistent to avoid unwanted effects.
Make the option persistent. A persistent option is always written to the command line, whatever its value. This is useful when the chosen default value does not match with the actual default value of the underlying utility.
The full command line to execute the associated underlying utility. This command line is based on a mechanism of tags that are replaced at run-time. The supported tags are:<ul><li><b>%filterargs</b>: command options</li><li><b>%filterinput</b>: input specification</li><li><b>%filteroutput</b>: output specification</li><li><b>%psu</b>: the page size in upper case</li><li><b>%psl</b>: the page size in lower case</li></ul>
Input specification when the underlying utility reads input data from a file. Use the tag <b>%in</b> to represent the input filename.
Output specification when the underlying utility writes output data to a file. Use the tag <b>%out</b> to represent the output filename.
Input specification when the underlying utility reads input data from its standard input.
Output specification when the underlying utility writes output data to its standard output.
A comment about the underlying utility, which can be viewed by the user from the interface. This comment string supports basic HTML tags like &lt;a&gt;, &lt;b&gt; or &lt;i&gt;.

KDE Printing Management
(c) 2000 - 2002 Michael Goffioul
<h1>Printers</h1>The KDE printing manager is part of KDEPrint which is the interface to the real print subsystem of your Operating System (OS). Although it does add some additional functionality of its own to those subsystems, KDEPrint depends on them for its functionality. Spooling and filtering tasks, especially, are still done by your print subsystem, or the administrative tasks (adding or modifying printers, setting access rights, etc.)<br/> What print features KDEPrint supports is therefore heavily dependent on your chosen print subsystem. For the best support in modern printing, the KDE Printing Team recommends a CUPS based printing system.

Ignore dependencies
Skips all dependency checks. Enable only if you know what you are doing.
Ignore backups
Ignores file backup designations when removing packages, which means .pacsave files will not be generated.
Cascade
When removing packages, removes also all packages that depend on one or more target packages. This operation is recursive, and must be used with care since it can remove many potentially needed packages.
Recursive removal
When removing packages, removes also all of their dependencies, provided that they are not required by other packages and they were not explicitly installed by the user. This option helps keeping a clean system without orphans.
Complete recursive removal
When removing packages, removes also all of their dependencies, provided that they are not required by other packages.
Remove database entry only
When removing packages, removes only the entry from the database, but not the files. Enable only if you know what you are doing.
Ignore package scriptlets
Ignores packages' scripts. Enable only if you know what you are doing.
Download packages only
When installing or upgrading packages, downloads the package only without installing or upgrading it. Enable only if you know what you are doing.
Install all packages as explicitly installed
When installing or upgrading packages, installs every package marking it as explicitly installed, even if it is a dependency. Enable only if you know what you are doing.
Install all packages as dependencies
When installing or upgrading packages, installs every package marking it as a dependency, even if it was explicitly selected. Enable only if you know what you are doing.

Fixes the path MTU discovery problem by inserting a special firewall rule.
Problem: TCP connections using the PPTP Client host as a hop in the route (such as via normal routing, NAT or IP masquerading) freeze once they attempt to transfer large amounts of data. Diagnosis: path MTU discovery may not be working, due to hosts on the route refusing to forward ICMP fragmentation needed responses.

Here you can set various options for the connection status check.
Connection Status Check
<qt>If checked, the connection status check will be enabled. The parameters below control how often the gateway will be pinged, and the minimum number which must succeed.<br/>Example: interval 1, success count 4: this means that 4 pings will be done, and a minimum of one must be successful to keep the connection alive. The delay between pings is 1 sec.</qt>

Enter the file name pattern of the files to search here. You may give several patterns separated by commas.
Choose one search mode. For the first modes, the search pattern is built from the editable template, where '%s' is replaced by the given pattern.<br><br>There are additional fixed predefined modes for environments, graphics, labels, references and input files. If the pattern is empty, Kile will search for all commands of this mode. If a pattern is given, it will be inserted as a parameter. For example, in environment mode with pattern 'center', Kile will search for '\begin{center}', and in graphics mode with pattern '.*\.png', Kile will search for all png files.
For the first three modes you can choose a template for the pattern from the combo box and edit it here. The string %s in the template is replaced by the pattern input field, resulting in the regular expression to search for. In all other modes this template is ignored.
Enter the directory which contains the files you want to search in.

Applies a PDF watermark to the background of a single input PDF. Pdftk uses only the first page from the background PDF and applies it to every page of the input PDF. This page is scaled and rotated as needed to fit the input page.
Applies a foreground stamp on top of the input PDF document's pages. Pdftk uses only the first page from the stamp PDF and applies it to every page of the input PDF. This page is scaled and rotated as needed to fit the input page. This works best if the stamp PDF page has a transparent background.

<p>...that you can create your own templates? Create a document containing the text you usually start with and save it; then, select "Create Template from Document" from the "File" menu, fill in the dialog and you are done: the next time you create a new document, you can select the template from the template list.</p>
<p>...that Kile supports forward search? This enables you to switch back and forth between places in the source file and their corresponding locations in the DVI file. Stop spending so much time on finding the place in the source file: if you spotted a mistake while viewing the DVI, finding the correct location is just a mouse-click away!</p> <p><a href="help:/kile/quick_inverseforward.html">Read the manual to find out how to activate this feature.</a></p>
<p>...that using projects gives Kile much more power? You can, for example, bundle and archive all related documents in a project; also, features like auto-completion of references and citations become much more powerful. Kile is even able to determine which document is the master document in a project.</p>
<p>...that you can configure which QuickBuild command is issued for a project? Just go to <b>Project->Project Options</b> and select a QuickBuild command.</p>
<p>...that inserting references and citations has never been easier? Enable auto-completion and type in <code>\ref{</code>, a list with all available labels will appear automatically (if auto-completion is not enabled, press Ctrl+Space).</p> <p>Note that this feature is much more powerful if the current document belongs to a project.</p> <p>You can configure auto-completion by going to <b>Settings->Configure Kile->Complete</b>; there, you can select databases of LaTeX commands. You can even create your own lists of commands.</p>
<p>...that Kile can complete LaTeX commands for you? Type <code>\se</code> and press Ctrl+Space, a list of all commands starting with <code>\se</code> will appear.</p> <p>You can configure auto-completion by going to <b>Settings->Configure Kile->Complete</b>; there, you can select databases of LaTeX commands. You can even create your own lists of commands.</p>
<p>...starting a new environment is very easy using the auto-complete feature. For example, type <code>equ</code> and press Alt+Space and a list of all environments starting with <code>equ</code> appears. Press Enter to select the first entry and a <code>\begin{equation}\end{equation}</code> pair is inserted in your document.</p> <p>You can configure auto-completion by going to <b>Settings->Configure Kile->Complete</b>; there, you can select databases of LaTeX commands. You can even create your own lists of commands.</p>
<p>...Kile contains several editing tools to help you type in LaTeX faster and easier? Check out the <b>Complete, Select, Delete, Environment and TeX Group</b> menus in the <b>Edit</b> menu.</p>
<p>...that the Quick Preview tool will compile and select a part of a document? This can be a <b>selected text</b>, the <b>current environment</b> or the <b>current subdocument</b>.</p> <p>You can configure Quick preview by going to <b>Settings->Configure Kile->Preview</b>. There, you can select one of the predefined configurations.</p>
<p>...that a wizard can help you create tabular environments and arrays?</p> <p>It allows to configure a lot of attributes: <b>alignment</b>, <b>colors</b>, <b>horizontal and vertical lines</b>, and more can be set. <b>Multicolumn cells</b> are also supported.</p>

Command:
This area contains the status messages for the game. Most of these messages are sent to you from the current engine.
This is the command line. You can type special commands related to the current engine in here. Most relevant commands are also available through the menus.
This is the button bar tool bar. It gives you easy access to game related commands. You can drag the bar to a different location within the window.
This is the status bar. It shows you the currently selected engine in the left corner.
KBackgammon settings
After you finished your moves, they have to be sent to the engine. You can either do that manually (in which case you should not enable this feature), or you can specify an amount of time that has to pass before the move is committed. If you undo a move during the timeout, the timeout will be reset and restarted once you finish the move. This is very useful if you would like to review the result of your move.
Enable timeout

Set Dice Values
Set the face values of the selected dice. The other player's dice will be cleared and it will be the dice's owner's turn.
This is the bar of the backgammon board.  Checkers that have been kicked from the board are put on the bar and remain there until they can be put back on the board. Checkers can be moved by dragging them to their destination or by using the 'short move' feature.  If the cube has not been doubled yet and if it can be used, its face shows 64 and if the cube can be doubled, double clicking it will do so.
This is a regular field of the backgammon board.  Checkers can be placed on this field and if the current state of the game and the dice permit this, they can be moved by dragging them to their destination or by using the 'short move' feature.
This part of the backgammon board is the home.  Depending on the direction of the game, one of the homes contains the dice and the other one contains checkers that have been moved off the board. Checkers can never be moved away from the home. If this home contains the dice and the current state of the game permits this, double clicking on the dice will roll them. Moreover, the cube might be placed on the home bar and if it can be doubled, double clicking it will do so.
A Backgammon program for KDE
This is a graphical backgammon program. It supports backgammon games with other players, games against computer engines like GNU bg and even on-line games on the 'First Internet Backgammon Server'.

This section contains data in your "workspace". This is data that you created or imported, in contrast to data contained in a loaded R package. Technically, this corresponds to the <i>.GlobalEnv</i> environment.
The package '%1' (probably you just loaded it) is currently blacklisted for retrieving structure information. Practically this means, the objects in this package will not appear in the object browser, and there will be no object name completion or function argument hinting for objects in this package. Packages will typically be blacklisted, if they contain huge amount of data, that would take too long to load. To unlist the package, visit Settings->Configure RKWard->Workspace.

Error starting R
A command in the R backend is trying to change the character encoding. While RKWard offers support for this, and will try to adjust to the new locale, this operation may cause subtle bugs, if data windows are currently open. Also the feature is not well tested, yet, and it may be advisable to save your workspace before proceeding. If you have any data editor opened, or in any doubt, it is recommended to close those first (this will probably be auto-detected in later versions of RKWard). In this case, please choose 'Cancel' now, then close the data windows, save, and retry.
Locale change
The R-backend has indicated that in order to carry out the current task it needs the package '%1', which is not currently installed. We will open the package-management tool, and there you can try to locate and install the needed package.
Require package '%1'
R backend requests information
The R backend will be shut down immediately. This means, you can not use any more functions that rely on it. I.e. you can do hardly anything at all, not even save the workspace (but if you're lucky, R already did that). What you can do, however, is save any open command-files, the output, or copy data out of open data editors. Quit RKWard after that. Sorry!

Question from the R backend
</p>	- The 'rkward' R-library either could not be loaded at all, or not in the correct version. This may lead to all sorts of errors, from single missing features to complete failure to function. The most likely cause is that the last installation did not place all files in the correct place. However, in some cases, left-overs from a previous installation that was not cleanly removed may be the cause.</p>		<p><b>You should quit RKWard, now, and fix your installation</b>. For help with that, see <a href="http://rkward.kde.org/compiling">http://rkward.kde.org/compiling</a>.</p>
<p>	-There was a problem setting up the communication with R. Most likely this indicates a broken installation.</p>		<p><b>You should quit RKWard, now, and fix your installation</b>. For help with that, see <a href="http://rkward.kde.org/compiling">http://rkward.kde.org/compiling</a>.</p></p>

<p>RKWard either could not find its resource files at all, or only an old version of those files. The most likely cause is that the last installation failed to place the files in the correct place. This can lead to all sorts of problems, from single missing features to complete failure to function.</p><p><b>You should quit RKWard, now, and fix your installation</b>. For help with that, see <a href="http://rkward.kde.org/compiling">http://rkward.kde.org/compiling</a>.</p>
Broken installation
Your installation of KDE is configured to use "native" file dialogs. This is known to cause issues in some cases, and we recommend to disable "native" file dialogs. Should "native" file dialogs be disabled in RKWard?
Potential problem with your configuration
Yes, disable
No, use "native" file dialogs
<p>You are about to start an RKWard dialog from outside of RKWard, probably by clicking on an 'rkward://'-link, somewhere. In case you have found this link on an external website, please bear in mind that R can be used to run arbitrary commands on your computer, <b>potentially including downloading and installing malicious software</b>. If you do not trust the source of the link you were following, you should press 'Cancel', below.</p><p>In case you click 'Continue', no R code will be run, unless and until you click 'Submit' in the dialog window, and you are encouraged to review the generated R code, before doing so.</p><p><i>Note</i>: Checking 'Do not ask again' will suppress this message for the remainder of this session, only.

New plugins found
The following RKWard pluginmap files could not be loaded, and have been disabled. This could be because they are broken, not compatible with this version of RKWard, or not meant for direct loading (see the 'Details' for more information). They have been disabled.
Failed to load some plugin maps
Some errors were encountered while loading the following RKWard pluginmap files. This could be because individual plugins are broken or not compatible with this version of RKWard (see the 'Details' for more information). Other plugins were loaded, successfully, however.
Note: You will not be warned about these pluginmap files again, until you upgrade RKWard, or remove and re-add them in Settings->Configure RKWard->Plugins.

<p>The initial working directory to use. Note that if you are loading a workspace on startup, and you have configured RKWard to change to the directory of loaded workspaces, that directory will take precedence.</p>
The workplace layout (i.e. which script-, data-, help-windows are open) may be saved (and loaded) per R workspace, or independent of the R workspace. Which do you prefer?
Save/restore with R workspace, when saving/loading R workspace
Save/restore independent of R workspace (save at end of RKWard session, restore at next start)
Do not save/restore workplace layout
When loading a workspace, change to the corresponding directory.
Warn when editing objects with more than this number of fields (0 for no limit):

Default graphics device
RKWard native device
Platform default device
Other device:
<p>The default device to be used for plotting, i.e. when new plot is created, while no graphics device is active (see <i>options("device")</i>).</p><p>The RKWard native device is the recommended choice for most users. This corresponds to the R command <i>RK()</i>.</p><p>The 'Platform default device' corresponds to one of <i>X11()</i>, <i>windows()</i>, or <i>quartz()</i>, depending on the platform.</p><p>You can also specify the name of a function such as <i>cairoDevice</i>.</p>
Integration of R standard devices
Replace with RKWard device
Embed original device
No device integration
<p>Many scripts use calls to platform specific standard devices (<i>X11()</i>, <i>windows()</i>, <i>quartz()</i>), although any on-screen device could be used at these places. RKWard provides overloads for these standard device functions, which can change their behavior when used in user code:</p><ul><li>The calls can be re-directed to the RKWard native device (<i>RK()</i>). Some, but not all function arguments will be matched, others will be ignored.</li><li>The original platform specific devices can be used, but embedded into RKWard windows. This option is not available on MacOS X.</li><li>The original platform specific devices can be used unchanged, without the addition of RKWard specific features.</li></ul><p>Regardless of this setting, the original devices are always accessible as <i>grDevices::X11()</i>, etc.</p><p>Using a device on a platform where it is not defined (e.g. <i>Windows()</i> on Mac OS X) will always fall back to the <i>RK()</i> device.</p>

You have tried to embed a new R graphics device window in RKWard. However, either no window was created, or RKWard failed to detect the new window.

You are about to edit object "%1", which is very large (%2 fields). RKWard is not optimized to handle very large objects in the built in data editor. This will use a lot of memory, and - depending on your system - might be very slow. For large objects it is generally recommended to edit using command line means or to split into smaller chunks before editing. On the other hand, if you have enough memory, or the data is simple enough (numeric data is easier to handle, than factor), editing may not be a problem at all. You can configure this warning (or turn it off entirely) under Settings->Configure RKWard->General. Really edit object?

Speech Model
Simon needs a model of your voice.
Scenarios
Scenarios are specific use cases of voice recognition.  For example, you can configure Simon to control the Firefox web browser by importing the Firefox scenario.
Simon can be set up to use a central server on the network. The model generation and recognition will then happen on the server, disburdening the clients.  Most users will leave this page to the default values. You can find more information on the topic in the Simon manual.
Connect automatically when Simon starts
Local installation (Default)
Use a local (private) recognition server (Simond) installed and running on this computer.
Start the server automatically when Simon starts
Stop the server automatically when Simon stops
Use central server on the network

Welcome to the Import of your Grammar
This wizard will allow you to select textfiles or input text from which Simon will then create your personal grammar profile.  To do this each of the files / the input text will be read by a grammar parser which will look up every single word in your dictionary-corpus. If the word is found its category will be added to the sentence. This way the parsers will find valid grammatical sentences on category level.  This process requires a large shadow dictionary containing category information or targeted input material.

Unable to construct a GUI element. Your KMLDonkey installation is incomplete.
Unable to construct a requested GUI element. This is most likely because the GUI specification data file (kmldonkeyui.rc) has been installed in the wrong location, or has not been installed at all. If you installed KMLDonkey from a binary package, please report this to the packager at once. If you installed from source, check that you configured KMLDonkey to use the same install prefix as your KDE installation (see the README file accompanying the KMLDonkey source for details), and that your system does not keep KDE files in non-standard locations (Mandriva Linux systems, in particular, are known to do this).

Text &encoding:
The character set to use to decode the strings sent by the core.
<p>Although MLDonkey does not understand about character encodings, you may well encounter text on the Donkey network that has been encoded in various national character sets. While you should, in general, use the ISO 8859-1 encoding - the de-facto network standard - you can choose a different character encoding here if you expect most of the text you encounter to be encoded in a certain national character set.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> Changing this causes KMLDonkey to reconnect to the core. Changing it to something incompatible with the ISO 8859-1 character set <em>may</em> cause unpredictable behavior.</p>

<h1>"%1" could not be started.</h1><p>Please note that kio-locate can't be used on its own. You need an additional program for doing searches. Typically this is the command line tool <i>locate</i> that can be found in many distributions by default. You can check if the correct tool is used by looking at the <a href="locater:config">setting</a> "Locate Binary".</p><p>Besides the mentioned tool <i>locate</i>, kio-locate can use any tool that uses the same syntax. In particular, it was reported to work with <i>slocate</i> and <i>rlocate</i></p>.

Additional Arguments for locate
A path must match at least one of the regular expressions in the White List and it must not match any of the expressions in the Black List for being displayed as a hit.
A path must match at least one of these regular expressions.
White List
A path must not match any of these regular expressions.
Black List
<i>Hint:</i> E.g. replacing the default '.' entry by '^/home/user/' will only allow hits in the home directory of user.
Locate Settings
<p>kio-locate does not handle the settings of locate, because this setup varies among different distributions. There are even distributions that use replacements like slocate.</p> <p>To configure locate you should take a look at the manpage of locate. Since most distributions use cron for updating locate's database, it may also be useful to take a look at the manpage of crontab.</p>
Use these settings only if you really know what you do. Otherwise the default should be ok.
Locate &binary:
<i>Hint:</i> If you don't specify a value here (which is the default), kio-locate will automatically pick slocate, rlocate or locate (in that order).
Additional &arguments:
Do not use -r or -i here. The first will confuse kio-locate, while the latter can be changed through the caseSensitivity option.
<i>Hint:</i> Do not use -r or -i here. The first will confuse kio-locate, and the latter can be changed through the "Case sensitivity" option.
Case se&nsitivity:
"Auto" for automatic case sensitivity determination (lowercase pattern -> case insensitive, upper or mixedcase pattern -> case sensitive), "Sensitive" for case sensitive and "Insensitive" for case insensitive.
Auto
Sensitive
Insensitive
<i>Hint:</i> With "Auto" case sensitivity a pattern will be case insensitive if it is lowercase and case sensitive if it is mixed or uppercase.

PulseAudio
<p>PulseAudio is a sound server for POSIX and Win32 systems. A sound server is basically a proxy for your sound applications. It allows you to do advanced operations on your sound data as it passes between your application and your hardware. Things like transferring the audio to a different machine, changing the sample format or channel count and mixing several sounds into one are easily achieved using a sound server.</p>
<p>TODO: add pulseaudio info!</p>

&Text files:
<qt>Enter here, or select clicking the file picker button, the name and location of the folder used to find and synchronize text files. All files with extension .txt located in this folder will be synced to Palm DOC databases in your handheld.</qt>
Local co&py:
<qt>Check this box if you want to save a copy of the Palm DOC databases (.pdb files) on your PC.</qt>
Synchronization Mode
Sync only P&C to PDA
<qt>Select this option to synchronize texts changed in your PC to Palm DOC databases in your handheld. Palm DOC databases modified in the handheld will not be converted to text files, but texts changed in the PC will be converted to the Palm DOC databases.</qt>
Sync only P&DA to PC
<qt>Select this option to synchronize the changes made to Palm DOC databases in your handheld to the PC text files. Palm DOC databases modified in the handheld will be converted to text files, but texts changed in the PC will not be converted to the Palm DOC databases.</qt>
Sync &all
<qt>Select this option to synchronize the file texts in your PC to Palm DOC databases in your handheld. Palm DOC databases modified in the handheld will be converted to text files, and texts changed in the PC will be converted to the Palm DOC databases, keeping both versions in sync.</qt>
<qt>Enter here, or select clicking the file picker button, the name and location of the folder where copies of the handheld databases are kept (.pdb files). Local copies are only made if the box is checked as well.</qt>
PC -> Handheld
&Compress
Check this box, if the text should be compressed on the handheld to save memory. Most doc reader on the handheld support compressed texts.
<qt>The Palm DOC format supports compressing the text to save memory. Check this box to enable text compression, so the resulting Palm DOC database will consume about 50% less memory than in uncompressed state. Almost all DOC readers on the Palm support compressed texts.</qt>
Convert &bookmarks
<qt>Check this box to enable bookmark creation when converting text files to Palm DOC databases. Most doc readers support bookmarks. In order to create a bookmark, it is necessary to provide the location in the text where the bookmark should be set and the bookmark title, in at least one of the formats listed below.</qt>
&Inline tags in text
Check this box to create bookmarks from inline tags in the text. The inline tag consist of tags in the form <* bookmarktext *>. The bookmark location is set using the location of the inline tag in the text, and  the name is the text between the <* and the *>. The inline tag (<*...*>) will be removed from the text.
&Encoding:
&Tags at end of text
Check this box to convert tags of the form <bookmarkname> at the end of the text to bookmarks. The text inside the tag ("bookmarkname") will be searched in the text, and whenever found, a bookmark will be set there. The endtags <...> will then be removed from the end of the text.
Regular &expressions in .bmk file
<qt>Check this box to use regular expressions in a file to search the text for bookmarks. The file should have the same name as the text file, but should end in .bmk instead of .txt (for instance, the regular expression file for textname.txt should be textname.bmk). See the documentation for a description of the format of the bmk file.</qt>
Handheld -> PC
Do not convert, if text unchanged (only bookmarks)
<qt>Check this box to avoid syncing the text on the handheld to the PC if you only changed the bookmarks on the handheld (but not the text).</qt>
Convert Bookmarks
Do &not convert bookmarks
<qt>Check this box to avoid converting Palm DOC bookmarks to inline tags or to a bookmark file.</qt>
Convert into .bm &file
<qt>Check this box to convert the Palm DOC database bookmarks to a separate file, in the bmk format (see more about this format in the documentation). The resulting bookmark file shares the same filename as the resulting .txt file, but ends in .bmk instead. This approach creates a clean text file and a bookmark file.</qt>
Convert as &inline tags
<qt>Check this box to convert the Palm DOC database bookmarks to inline tags, in the form &lt;* BookmarkName *&gt;. These tags are inserted in the text in the position marked by the bookmark, and the text inside the tag corresponds to the bookmark name. Inline tags are easy to create, delete, move and edit.</qt>
If the same text was changed on the PC and the handheld, which of the two versions should be used as the new version?
<qt>The Palm DOC conduit does not feature merging the modifications when a text is changed both in the handheld and in the computer. Therefore, the choice is between working with the files out of sync, or discarding the changes in one of them.</qt>

Convert Text to PalmDOC
Convert PalmDOC to Text
Enter the name of the folder where the text files reside on the PC. All files with extension .txt will be synced to the handheld.
When a <* bookmarktext *> appears somewhere in the text, a bookmark will be set at this position, and the text between the <* and the *> will be used as bookmark name. The <*...*> will be removed from the text.
Tags of the form <bookmarkname> at the end of the text will be used to search the text for the pattern between the < and >. Whenever "bookmarkname" appears in the text, a bookmark will be set there. The endtags <...> will then be removed from the end of the text.
The Palm doc format supports compressing the text to save memory. If you check this box, the text will consume about 50% less memory than in uncompressed state. Almost all DOC readers on the Palm support compressed texts.
Do you want to convert bookmarks? Most doc readers support bookmarks. You have to provide some information about where the bookmarks should be set and their titles. Check at least one of the bookmark types below.
Use regular expressions in a file textname.bmk (textname.txt is the filename of the text) to search the text for bookmarks.See the documentation for a description of the format of the bmk file.

<qt>This conduit appears to be broken and cannot be configured.</qt>
<qt><p><i>Conduits</i> are external (possibly third-party) programs that perform synchronization actions. They may have individual configurations. Select a conduit to configure it, and enable it by clicking on its checkbox. </p></qt>
<qt><p>The <i>general</i> portion of KPilot's setup contains settings for your hardware and the way KPilot should display your data. For the basic setup, which should fulfill the need of most users, just use the setup wizard below.</p><p>If you need some special settings, this dialog provides all the options for fine-tuning KPilot. But be warned: The HotSync settings are various esoteric things.</p><p>You can enable an action or conduit by clicking on its checkbox. Checked conduits will be run during a HotSync.

Prevent HotSync when screen locked
Turning this option on prevents syncing 	when the screen is locked. This is a security measure 	to prevent people from stealing your data through physical 	access to a Pilot device link to your machine. 	It does not work with screensavers other than KDE, though, 	so you will need to turn it off for other environments.
The configuration file is outdated.
The configuration file has version %1, while KPilot needs version %2.
Please run KPilot and check the configuration carefully to update the file.
Important changes to watch for are:
Renamed conduits, Kroupware and file installer have been made conduits as well.
Conflict resolution is now a global setting.
Changed format of no-backup databases.
Calendar, ToDo, and Contacts conduits are now using KDE4's Akonadi server and require valid Akonadi resources to sync.
The configuration file for KPilot is out-of date. Please run KPilot to update it.
Configuration File Out-of Date
The configuration file for KPilot is out-of date. KPilot can update some parts of the configuration automatically. Do you wish to continue?
